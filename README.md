<h3>How does it work?</h3>

      Convolutional Neural Network is used to analyze and classify audio segments based on spectrograms <a href="https://codepen.io/naotokui/pen/rrGGNJ" target="_">(demo codepen)</a> and Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM) for generating drum sequences.<p>

      Shout-out to Tero Parviainen! Rhythm generation part of this codepen is based on his amazing <a href=" https://codepen.io/teropa/pen/JLjXGK">Neural Drum Machine</a>
